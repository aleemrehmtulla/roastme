# Roast Me 🔥

⚠️ warning: your self confidence may be damaged by this app

this is a site that combines the latest img2text model by salesforce with gpt4 to flame you in a super funny & creative way <:)

### Setup

1. You'll need an OpenAI API key, which you can get [here](https://beta.openai.com/).
2. You'll also need a Replicate API key, which you can get [here](https://replicate.ai/).
3. Add those two keys to a new file named `.env`, following the `.envExample` structure.
4. That's it! You're ready to go! 🚀

If you look around, you'll see you can update the default image and text, and even prompts used in our edge function that streams roasts!

### Run it locally

1. Open the terminal
2. Run `npm install` to grab the necceary packages
3. Hit `npm run dev` to start your server on `http://localhost:3000`

Having trouble? Make sure you have node installed, and that you're running the latest version of npm. Otherwise open an issue and I'll help ya out!

### Deploy to the world

1. Push all your changes to Github (or another git provider)
2. Head to vercel.app, import your repo, and hit deploy
3. Go to settings of the deployment, add your .env, and rebuild

Not working? Double check your vercel logs, if there's any timeouts you may need to change plans. You can also host this on your own server!

### LESGOO! We're off localhost 😁

That's all!! Now you can roast your friends, family, and even yourself 🔥
